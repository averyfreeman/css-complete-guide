# Udemy CSS: The Complete Guide

This is a tutorial I did through Udemy to learn CSS. Covers basics, mobile-first design strategy, grids, flexbox, animations, position parameters, typology, etc.

I already knew a bit about CSS before taking this course, but I wanted to have a deeper understanding of how it works. I took the exercises very seriously, and expanded on the lessons, adding a few things like color gradients, transitions, and large-viewport responsive layouts (960+ pixel width). I spent quite a bit of time researching the material comprehensively and experimenting outside of the lessons, since I believe a fulsom understanding of CSS is important for any front-end project.

My personal workflow preference is to use a CSS library for positioning elements quickly (e.g. Bootstrap's grid system) coupled either with Styled Components or SCSS.
